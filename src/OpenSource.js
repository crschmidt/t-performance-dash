      # Icons: CC BY 4.0 License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)<br />
      In the Font Awesome Free download, the CC BY 4.0 license applies to all icons<br />
      packaged as SVG and JS file types.<br />
      <br />
      # Fonts: SIL OFL 1.1 License (https://scripts.sil.org/OFL)<br />
      In the Font Awesome Free download, the SIL OFL license applies to all icons<br />

      # Attribution<br />
      Attribution is required by MIT, SIL OFL, and CC BY licenses. Downloaded Font<br />

      <br />
      We've kept attribution comments terse, so we ask that you do not actively work<br />
      to remove them from files, especially code. They're a great way for folks to<br />
      learn about Font Awesome.<br />
